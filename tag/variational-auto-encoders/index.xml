      <title>Notes on the Reparametrization Trick</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most popular articles of the last years in the Machine Learning community is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6114.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes&lt;/a&gt;, which also includes the so-called reparametrization trick. Intrigued by what was sketched in the article, I decided to work out the details of this reparametrization, covering 2 of the 3 cases described (but I guess the third one can be derived from the first 2). I want to share my calculations with you. I have learned (and reviewed) a lot in the process, which was not directly related to the equations themselves. Sharing is the only way to make real progress as a community. Have a look 

&lt;a href=&#34;https://diningphil.github.io/uploads/reparamtrick_notes.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;
, and please contact me in case the steps are not correct or contain imprecise notation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update, 2018-12-10&lt;/em&gt;: I have added the solution of the integrals of Appendix B. This was really useful to get familiar with the gaussian integral and Fubini&amp;rsquo;s theorem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to Iacopo Ripoli for his decisive and helpful insights!&lt;/p&gt;
